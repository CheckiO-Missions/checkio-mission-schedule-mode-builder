<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    You are given an unordered {% if is_js %}array{% else %} list{% endif %} of tasks. Each task is as string, which incudes a start and end of task and has a view <b>"hh:mm-hh:mm"</b>. Tasks are unique. You function must return chronologically sorted, filtered {% if is_js %}array{% else %}list{% endif %} of tasks, which can be scheduled without overlapping. For this purpose, you are also given a <b>mode</b> as {% if is_js %}a number{% else %}an integer{% endif %}, which tells you the rule of choosing non-overlapping tasks.
</p>
<p>
    Modes:
    <ul>
        <li><b>1</b>: earliest start among available, (if a few variants) shortest duration;</li>
        <li><b>2</b>: earliest start among available, (if a few variants) longest duration;</li>
        <li><b>3</b>: longest <b>total</b> duration of chosen tasks, (if a few variants) larger number of tasks done, (if a few variants) earliest;</li>
        <li><b>4</b>: larger number of tasks done, (if a few variants) longest <b>total</b> duration of chosen tasks, (if a few variants) earliest.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    At animation tasks are always sorted as earliest start + shortest duration. Each task is positioned on the first "row", where it is not overlapping with the previous task in a "row". If the current task is overlapping with all existed "rows" - the new "row" is started.
    For example, for the input <b>[['09:00-10:00', '09:50-10:10', '10:00-11:00', '09:00-09:20', '10:50-11:10'], 2]</b>, the animation (solved) would be the following:
